    <p>I am an Assistant Professor at the Applied Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Unit, The Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Institute, University of Southern Denmark (since July 2023).</p>
    <p>I conduct research in Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a special focus in Deep Learning, Federated Learning (a.k.a Decentralized Machine Learning), Graph Machine Learning, and Machine Unlearning. My work aims to develop novel AI algorithms that enhance performance, protect privacy, and promote fairness. I apply these algorithms in Healthcare, the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT), and Fusion Energy.</p>
    <p>Aside from fundamental research in AI, I have also been developing AI-driven diagnostic systems for Colorectal Cancer, Cardio Calcification, Cervical Cancer, and Dementia, with the goal of improving patient management through more accurate and timely diagnostics.</p>
