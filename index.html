    <p>I am an Assistant Professor at the Applied Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Unit, The Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Institute, University of Southern Denmark (since July 2023).</p>
    <p>My research focuses on Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in Deep Learning, Federated Learning (also known as Decentralized Machine Learning), Graph Machine Learning, and Machine Unlearning. I apply these technologies in Healthcare, the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT), and Fusion Energy. My work aims to develop novel AI algorithms that enhance performance, protect privacy, and promote fairness by mitigating bias.</p>
    <p>Aside from the fundamental research in AI, I have also been developing AI-driven early detection systems for Colorectal Cancer, Cardio Calcification, Cervical Cancer, and Dementia, striving to improve patient management through advanced diagnostic tools.</p>

  <p>I am an IEEE Senior Member and a member of the editorial board for the IEEE Sensors Journal. I  was a recipient of the ERCIM Alain Bensoussan Fellowship in 2019 and the Best Paper Award at APSIPA ASC-2021, Tokyo, Japan.  I was also a recipient of the <a href="https://hcoersted.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Pressemeddelelse-2024-final.pdf">HC Ørsted Research Talent Award</a>, 2024, Denmark. </p>

  <h2>Collaboration Opportunities</h2>
  <p>I am open to collaborations with both academia and industry. If you are interested in partnering on research projects or innovative AI applications, please feel free to reach out to me.</p>
  <p>For postdoc candidates with a background in AI or Large-Scale Optimization, I encourage you to review our recent work. If it aligns with your interests and you wish to join our team, please send me your CV. While fully funded positions may not always be available, I (our unit) will support your fellowship applications to Danish and European funding agencies. </p>
