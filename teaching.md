As an assistant professor specializing in artificial intelligence (AI), I am passionate about advancing the field through research while mentoring the next generation of AI professionals. I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical AI concepts and their real-world applications in the classroom. This dual commitment to both research and teaching enables me to cultivate a dynamic learning environment where students are encouraged to engage deeply with AI concepts and explore how they can be applied to real-world challenges.

I view my role as a guide and facilitator rather than a traditional teacher. I believe learning is a dynamic, two-way process in which students actively construct their own knowledge. My goal is to inspire curiosity and a passion for learning while providing the necessary tools and guidance to help students unlock their creativity, develop critical thinking skills, and apply their knowledge in meaningful ways. By fostering an environment of exploration, critical inquiry, and hands-on application, I help students build the skills they need to excel academically and professionally.

To achieve this, I emphasize student-centered learning, recognizing that each student brings a unique set of experiences, strengths, and challenges. I tailor my teaching strategies to accommodate these differences.
